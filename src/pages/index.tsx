      <p className="py-1 px-3 mb-3">
        I am the CEO and founder of{" "}
        <Link href="https://shopstr.store/">Shopstr</Link>, a Nostr marketplace
        client focused on facilitating anonymous, p2p transactions using Bitcoin
        and ecash.

        My focus has been on contributing to freedom tech, particularly Bitcoin
        and Nostr.
      </p>
      <p className="py-1 px-3 mb-3">
        I believe that Bitcoin has the potential to open up previously ignored
        or irrelevant countries to the rest of the world in regards to financial
        access and tapping into their human capital. I think it is the most
        important free market monetary system that has existed in the history of
        humanity.

      <p className="py-1 px-3 mb-3">
        Nostr, on the other hand, facilitates the adoption and spread of Bitcoin
        while also allowing for the construction of globally distributed,
        decentralized, and interoperable applications. Whether that be for
        social media platforms, search engines, collaborative tools, or anything
        else you can think of, Nostr is restructuring the internet as we know
        it.
