        <strong>This is Thoughts</strong>, a newsletter about my takes on anything I can wrap my mind around. I plan on making this a monthly thing and will be giving my analysis on books, podcasts, and articles that I have read and/or listened to, as well as my own personal anecdotes and views on subjects I am interested in. I don’t have any exact plans with this blog apart from it acting as a collection of my thoughts. I have no substantial experience with writing or any form of content creation, but I’m excited to get started with this experiment. I hope you all tag along for the journey.
